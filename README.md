# VPN Hands-on Setup and Privacy Report
## 📌 Objective

To understand and demonstrate the practical use of a Virtual Private Network (VPN) to enhance online privacy and secure communications.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

| Tool/Platform          | Purpose                                |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------|
| ProtonVPN (Free Plan)  | Secure internet traffic via VPN        |
| Google Chrome          | Check HTTPS status                     |
| whatismyipaddress.com  | IP address verification                |
| speedtest.net          | Test speed with/without VPN            |
| Windows 11 OS          | Base operating system for testing      |

## 🧪 Steps Performed

1. **Selected VPN** – Chose ProtonVPN for its no-log policy and strong encryption.
2. **Installed Client** – Downloaded and set up ProtonVPN on Windows.
3. **Connected to VPN** – Chose Netherlands server and verified connection.
4. **Verified IP Masking** – Confirmed IP change using `whatismyipaddress.com`.
5. **Checked Encryption** – Used Chrome Dev Tools to verify TLS encryption.
6. **Tested Speed Impact** – Compared network performance before and after VPN use.
7. **Reviewed Protocols** – Analyzed protocols like OpenVPN, WireGuard, IKEv2/IPSec.
8. **Summarized Benefits & Limitations** – Noted key strengths and trade-offs of VPNs.

## 📈 Results

- ✅ IP masked successfully (India → Netherlands)
- ✅ HTTPS encryption verified
- ✅ VPN impact on speed observed (minor drop)
- ✅ Gained understanding of tunneling, protocols, and encryption

## 📚 Key Learnings

- Role of VPNs in modern cybersecurity
- Privacy preservation via encryption and IP masking
- VPN limitations (speed, geo-restrictions, partial anonymity)
- Comparison of VPN protocols

## 🏁 Conclusion

This task helped build foundational skills in VPN usage and reinforced cybersecurity principles related to traffic encryption, privacy, and secure browsing.
